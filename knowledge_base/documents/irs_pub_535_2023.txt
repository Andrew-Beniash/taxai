### Introduction

### What's New

service during the tax year exceeds $2,890,000.

### Deducting Business Expenses
To be deductible, a business expense must be both ordinary and necessary. An ordinary expense
is one that is common and accepted in your trade or business. A necessary expense is one that
is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business.

### Business Use of Your Home
If you use part of your home for business, you may be able to deduct expenses for the business
use of your home. These expenses may include mortgage interest, insurance, utilities, repairs,
and depreciation.

### Car and Truck Expenses
If you use your car or truck in your business, you may be able to deduct the costs of operating
and maintaining your vehicle. You can either deduct the actual expenses or use the standard
mileage rate.
