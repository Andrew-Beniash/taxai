## Farmer's Tax Guide

### Introduction
This publication explains how the federal tax laws apply to farming.

### What's New
For 2023, the maximum amount you can elect to deduct for most section 179 property you placed
in service in 2023 is $1,160,000.

### Farm Income
You must include various types of income on your tax return, including income from the sale of
livestock, produce, grains, and other products you raised.

### Farm Business Expenses
The ordinary and necessary costs of operating a farm for profit are deductible business expenses.
These include the costs of feed, seed, fertilizer, and similar farm supplies.

### Depreciation, Section 179 Deduction, and Special Depreciation Allowance
If you buy farm property such as machinery, equipment, or structures that have a useful life of
more than a year, you generally cannot deduct the entire cost in the year you buy it. Instead,
you must depreciate these assets.
