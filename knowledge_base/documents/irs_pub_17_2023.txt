## Your Federal Income Tax For Individuals

### Introduction
This publication covers the general rules for filing a federal income tax return.

### What's New
For 2023, the standard deduction has increased to $13,850 for single filers and $27,700 for
married couples filing jointly.

### Filing Requirements
You must file a federal income tax return if your income is above a certain level, which varies
depending on your filing status, age, and the type of income you received.

### Filing Status
Your filing status is used to determine your filing requirements, standard deduction, eligibility
for certain credits, and your correct tax. There are five filing statuses: Single, Married Filing
Jointly, Married Filing Separately, Head of Household, and Qualifying Surviving Spouse.

### Dependents
You can claim a dependent on your tax return if they meet certain tests. This can affect your
eligibility for certain tax benefits.
