        expense deduction is $1,160,000. This limit is reduced by the amount by which the cost of 
        section 179 property placed in service during the tax year exceeds $2,890,000.
        
        Section 179 property includes most tangible personal property such as machinery and equipment
        purchased for use in a trade or business, and, if elected, qualified real property. Section 179
